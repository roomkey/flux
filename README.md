# flux

A Clojure based Solr client. Current Apache Solr version support is `4.9.0`.

## Installation (Leiningen)

To include the Flux library, add the following to your `:dependencies`:

    [com.codesignals/flux "0.5.0"]

## Usage

###Http

```clojure
(require '[flux.http :as http])

(def conn (http/create "http://localhost:8983/solr" :collection1))
```

###Embedded

```clojure
(require '[flux.embedded :as embedded])

(def cc (embedded/create-core-container "path/to/solr-home" "path/to/solr.xml"))
```

####Core auto-discovery
Flux also supports `core.properties`. Just give `create-core` the solr-home path as the only argument.

  Note: It's important to call the `load` method on the resulting `CoreContainer` instance:

```clojure
(def cc (doto (embedded/create-core-container "path/to/solr-home")
              (.load))
```

Now create the embedded server instance:

```clojure
(def conn (embedded/create cc :collection1))
```

###Client
Once a connection as been created, use the `with-connection` macro to wrap client calls:

```clojure
(require '[flux.core :as flux]
          [flux.query :as q])

(flux/with-connection conn
    (flux/add [{:id 1} {:id 2}])
    (flux/commit)
    (flux/query "*:*")
    ;; Or set the path and/or method:
    (flux/request
      (q/create-query-request :post "/docs" {:q "etc"}))
```

###javax.servlet/servlet-api and EmbeddedSolrServer

Unfortunately, EmbeddedSolrServer requires javax.servlet/servlet-api as an implicit dependency. Because of this, Flux adds this lib as a depedency.

###Test
```shell
lein midje
```
